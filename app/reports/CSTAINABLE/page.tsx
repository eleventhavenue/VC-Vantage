                      According to search result 2, CO2 GRO Inc. (the predecessor company to Cstainable Inc.) had its

                    <p>
                      This indicates some form of regulatory action was taken against the company, though specific

                      The post suggests CO2 GRO was in financial difficulty, with suspended operations and a cease trade
                      order. This could potentially impact Cstainable Inc. if it is a successor company.
